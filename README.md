# docker-ocserv

docker-ocserv is an OpenConnect VPN Server boxed in a Docker image built by [Tommy Lau](mailto:tommy@gen-new.com) currently maintained by [Amin Vakil](mailto:info@aminvakil.com).

## Update on Mar 26, 2021

Upgrade alpine to 3.13.6 to use openssl 1.1.1k-r0.

**Important Note**:

Updating to this version is highly recommended becuase of this upgrade as [CVE-2021-3449](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210325.txt).

## Update on Dec 30, 2020

Upgrade alpine to 3.12.3 and ocserv to 1.1.2.

**Important Note**:

`isolate-workers = true` should be disabled in ocserv.conf, otherwise clients keep disconnecting after a while.

This has been set by default on the new docker images, but you should change your current containers with this command yourself:

```bash
docker exec YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME sed -i 's/^isolate-workers/#isolate-workers/' /etc/ocserv/ocserv.conf
```
## Update on Sep 05, 2020

Migrate from Docker Hub to Quay as they're going to put limit for those who aren't willing to give them money.

You should just change aminvakil/ocserv to quay.io/aminvakil/ocserv for the next updates. See "How to use this image" section for examples.

## Update on May 19, 2020

Change `--privileged` to `--sysctl net.ipv4_ip_forward=1 --cap-add NET_ADMIN --security-opt no-new-privileges` as they're the only privileges that this docker needs, so it would be unnecessary to give this container the whole privileges. ([Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege))

## Update on May 13, 2020

Upgraded base image and ocserv, remove group, other improvements

## What is OpenConnect Server?

[OpenConnect server (ocserv)](http://www.infradead.org/ocserv/) is an SSL VPN server. It implements the OpenConnect SSL VPN protocol, and has also (currently experimental) compatibility with clients using the [AnyConnect SSL VPN](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/anyconnect-vpn-client/tsd-products-support-series-home.html) protocol.

## How to use this image

Get the docker image by running the following commands:

```bash
docker pull quay.io/aminvakil/ocserv
```

Start an ocserv instance:

```bash
docker run --name ocserv --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 --cap-add NET_ADMIN --security-opt no-new-privileges -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp -d quay.io/aminvakil/ocserv
```

This will start an instance with the a test user named `test` and password is also `test`.

### Unstable version of this image

I'm maintaining a more updated (probably less stable) version of this image on `quay.io/aminvakil/ocserv:unstable` which its Dockerfile can be found on this repo on #unstable branch. I'd be glad if you could test it and give feedback on it.

### Environment Variables

All the variables to this image is optional, which means you don't have to type in any environment variables, and you can have a OpenConnect Server out of the box! However, if you like to config the ocserv the way you like it, here's what you wanna know.

`CA_CN`, this is the common name used to generate the CA(Certificate Authority).

`CA_ORG`, this is the organization name used to generate the CA.

`CA_DAYS`, this is the expiration days used to generate the CA.

`SRV_CN`, this is the common name used to generate the server certification.

`SRV_ORG`, this is the organization name used to generate the server certification.

`SRV_DAYS`, this is the expiration days used to generate the server certification.

`NO_TEST_USER`, while this variable is set to not empty, the `test` user will not be created. You have to create your own user with password. The default value is to create `test` user with password `test`.

The default values of the above environment variables:

|   Variable   |     Default     |
|:------------:|:---------------:|
|  **CA_CN**   |      VPN CA     |
|  **CA_ORG**  |     Big Corp    |
| **CA_DAYS**  |       9999      |
|  **SRV_CN**  | www.example.com |
| **SRV_ORG**  |    My Company   |
| **SRV_DAYS** |       9999      |

### Running examples

Start an instance out of the box with username `test` and password `test`

```bash
docker run --name ocserv --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 --cap-add NET_ADMIN --security-opt no-new-privileges -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp -d quay.io/aminvakil/ocserv
```

Start an instance with server name `my.test.com`, `My Test` and `365` days

```bash
docker run --name ocserv --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 --cap-add NET_ADMIN --security-opt no-new-privileges -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp -e SRV_CN=my.test.com -e SRV_ORG="My Test" -e SRV_DAYS=365 -d quay.io/aminvakil/ocserv
```

Start an instance with CA name `My CA`, `My Corp` and `3650` days

```bash
docker run --name ocserv --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 --cap-add NET_ADMIN --security-opt no-new-privileges -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp -e CA_CN="My CA" -e CA_ORG="My Corp" -e CA_DAYS=3650 -d quay.io/aminvakil/ocserv
```

A totally customized instance with both CA and server certification

```bash
docker run --name ocserv --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 --cap-add NET_ADMIN --security-opt no-new-privileges -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp -e CA_CN="My CA" -e CA_ORG="My Corp" -e CA_DAYS=3650 -e SRV_CN=my.test.com -e SRV_ORG="My Test" -e SRV_DAYS=365 -d quay.io/aminvakil/ocserv
```

Start an instance as above but without test user

```bash
docker run --name ocserv --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 --cap-add NET_ADMIN --security-opt no-new-privileges -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp -e CA_CN="My CA" -e CA_ORG="My Corp" -e CA_DAYS=3650 -e SRV_CN=my.test.com -e SRV_ORG="My Test" -e SRV_DAYS=365 -e NO_TEST_USER=1 -v /some/path/to/ocpasswd:/etc/ocserv/ocpasswd -d quay.io/aminvakil/ocserv
```

**WARNING:** The ocserv requires the ocpasswd file to start, if `NO_TEST_USER=1` is provided, there will be no ocpasswd created, which will stop the container immediately after start it. You must specific a ocpasswd file pointed to `/etc/ocserv/ocpasswd` by using the volume argument `-v` by docker as demonstrated above.

### User operations

All the users opertaions happened while the container is running. If you used a different container name other than `ocserv`, then you have to change the container name accordingly.

#### Add user

If say, you want to create a user named `test`, type the following command

```bash
docker exec -ti ocserv ocpasswd -c /etc/ocserv/ocpasswd test
Enter password:
Re-enter password:
```

When prompt for password, type the password twice, then you will have the user with the password you want.

#### Delete user

Delete user is similar to add user, just add another argument `-d` to the command line

```bash
docker exec -ti ocserv ocpasswd -c /etc/ocserv/ocpasswd -d test
```

The above command will delete the default user `test`, if you start the instance without using environment variable `NO_TEST_USER`.

#### Change password

Change password is exactly the same command as add user, please refer to the command mentioned above.
